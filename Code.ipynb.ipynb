    "# \n",
    "# # Introduction:\n",
    "# \n",
    "# The objective of this project is to analyze nursing facility performance by integrating multiple datasets related to staffing levels, penalties, and performance metrics. The data involved comes from different sources, including daily nurse staffing, SNF (Skilled Nursing Facility) VBP (Value-Based Purchasing) performance, and penalties imposed on facilities. This project aims to investigate the relationship between staffing levels (RN and CNA hours), penalties, and performance scores. Additionally, we will assess the impact of various factors, such as facility size and census levels, on performance outcomes.\n",
    "# \n",
    "# # The following steps will be carried out:\n",
    "# \n",
    "# Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and merging different datasets related to nurse staffing, facility performance, and penalties. We will ensure the data is consistent and free of anomalies.\n",
    "# \n",
    "# Hypothesis Testing: Formulating hypotheses to explore the relationships between staffing levels, facility performance, and penalties.\n",
    "# \n",
    "# Data Analysis: Grouping and aggregating data to analyze performance scores, staffing levels, and penalties.\n",
    "# \n",
    "# Visualization: Creating visual representations such as bar charts to present key insights derived from the data.\n",
    "# \n",
    "# Conclusions: Drawing conclusions and making recommendations based on the findings to help improve nursing facility operations.\n",

    "# # Data Sources:\n",
    "# \n",
    "# PBJ Daily Nurse Staffing Data (Q1 2024): Provides detailed information about daily nurse staffing levels, including hours worked by Registered Nurses (RN), Certified Nursing Assistants (CNA), and other staff.\n",
    "# SNF VBP Facility Performance Data (FY 2024): Contains performance metrics such as risk-standardized readmission rates, achievement scores, and incentive payment multipliers.\n",
    "# NH Penalties Data (August 2024): Lists penalties imposed on nursing facilities, including fine amounts and payment denial periods.\n",
    "# \n",
    "# # Methodology:\n",
    "# \n",
    "# Loading and Merging Datasets: The different datasets will be loaded, cleaned, and merged based on common identifiers such as CMS Certification Numbers (CCN). This step ensures that all relevant information is available in a single dataset for further analysis.\n",
    "# \n",
    "# Data Analysis and Hypothesis Testing: Various hypotheses will be tested to assess the relationship between staffing levels, facility size, penalties, and performance outcomes. Aggregation and grouping of data will be performed based on facility size, census levels, and staffing categories.\n",
    "# \n",
    "# Visualization and Reporting: The results will be visualized using bar charts and other graphical techniques to highlight patterns and trends in the data.\n",
    "# \n",
    "# Conclusions and Recommendations: Based on the analysis, key insights will be derived regarding how staffing levels and facility size impact performance and what improvements can be recommended for better outcomes in nursing facilitie\n",

    "# \n",
    "# Conclusion:\n",
    "# The analysis shows that facilities with high RN staffing levels tend to have slightly better performance scores compared to those with low or medium staffing levels. This supports the idea that more RN hours per resident are correlated with improved performance outcomes in facilities. However, the difference is not large, suggesting that while staffing levels contribute, other factors may also influence the performance.\n",

    "# CNA Staffing Analysis:\n",
    "# \n",
    "# Low CNA Staffing Level: Average Performance Score is 32.73, but with a very small facility count of 118.\n",
    "# Medium CNA Staffing Level: Average Performance Score is 30.73, with a facility count of 543.\n",
    "# High CNA Staffing Level: Average Performance Score is 30.21, with a large facility count of 1,886,864.\n",
    "# \n",
    "# Conclusion:\n",
    "# For CNA staffing levels, the low staffing group shows the highest performance score (32.73), but this category contains very few facilities (118). The high CNA staffing group has a slightly lower performance score (30.21) despite the large number of facilities. This could indicate that CNA staffing has a more complex relationship with performance, possibly influenced by facility size, resident needs, or other operational factors.\n",
    "# \n",
    "# General Conclusion:\n",
    "# RN Staffing Levels seem to have a more consistent positive correlation with performance scores, especially for facilities with high RN staffing.\n",
    "# CNA Staffing Levels exhibit a more varied result, where low CNA staffing performs well, but this is based on a very small sample size.\n",
    "# Facilities with high RN staffing are generally performing better, which highlights the importance of having a sufficient number of registered nurses in long-term care settings.\n",

    "# It is important to understand if the size of a facility, as measured by the number of residents (census), impacts its performance.

    "# \n",
    "# Low Census (Average Performance Score: 30.85, Facility Count: 507,078): Facilities with a lower resident census show strong performance scores, indicating they may have more manageable workloads and resources to focus on individual care.\n",
    "# \n",
    "# Medium Census (Average Performance Score: 30.30, Facility Count: 901,709): Facilities with medium census levels have a slightly lower average performance score than those with low census, suggesting a potential strain on resources as resident numbers increase.\n",

    "# High Census (Average Performance Score: 28.94, Facility Count: 442,628): Facilities with a high resident census display the lowest average performance scores, indicating challenges in maintaining quality care and performance as resident numbers rise.\n",
    "# \n",
    "# Very High Census (Average Performance Score: 33.18, Facility Count: 45,270): Surprisingly, facilities with a very high census have the highest average performance scores.

    "# The analysis highlights that performance scores tend to drop as census levels increase, particularly for high census facilities.

These successful large facilities may serve as models for high census facilities that struggle with performance.\n",
